# Overview

### What is Coda?

Coda is a cryptocurrency protocol that leverages zk-SNARKs to compress the blockchain. Participants in the protocol can generate SNARK proofs that historical blockchain states were valid, and use the proofs as a replacement for storing all the blockchain data. This effectively reduces the size of the blockchain to the equivalent of a couple tweets - allowing Coda to process more transactions and scale the network without worrying about block sizes.

### How Does it Work?
