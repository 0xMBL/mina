# Overview

### What is Coda?

Coda is a cryptocurrency protocol that leverages zk-SNARKs to compress the blockchain. Participants in the protocol can generate SNARK proofs that historical blockchain states were valid, and use the proofs as a replacement for storing all the blockchain data. This effectively reduces the size of the blockchain to that of a couple tweets.

### How Does it Work?
