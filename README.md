Coda is the first cryptocurrency with a lightweight, constant-sized blockchain. This is the main source code repository for the Coda project. It contains code for the Ocaml protocol implementation, website, and wallet.

## Note

- Coda is still under active development, and APIs are still evolving. If you do build upon the APIs, be aware that breaking changes may occur.
- There is  a live testnet of the Coda protocol currently running - [sign up here to join the testnet](http://bit.ly/TestnetForm).
