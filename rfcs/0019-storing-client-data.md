__NOTE: We refer `external_transitions` or transitions as blocks in this RFC__

# Summary

The Coda protocol contains many different types of objects (blocks, transactions, accounts) and these objects have relationships with each other. A client communicating with the protocol would often make queries involving the relationship of these objects (i.e. Find the 10 most recent transactions that Alice sent after sending transactions, TXN). This RFC will discuss how we can take advantage of these relationships by using relational databases. This will accelerate our process in writing concise and maintainable queries that are extremely performant. We will also discuss the pros and cons of using this new design.

# Motivation

The primary database that we use to store transactions and blocks is Rocksdb. When we load the Rocksdb databases, we read all of the key-value pairs and load them into an in-memory cache that is designed for making fast in-memory reads and pagination queries. The downside of this is that this design limits us from making complex queries. Namely, we make a pagination query that is sent from or received by a public key, but not strictly one or the other. Additionally, the indexes for the current design is limited to the keys of the database. This enables to answer queries about which transactions are in an block but not the other way around (i.e. for a given transaction, which blocks have the transaction). We can put this auxiliary information that tells us which blocks contain a certain transaction in the value of the transaction database. However, this results in verbose code and extra invariants to take care, leading to potential bugs. Relational databases are good at taking care of these type of details. Relational databases can give us more indexes and they can grant us more flexible and fast queries with less code.

This RFC will also formally define some APIs that a client would make (in the form of GraphQL queries) as some of them were loosely defined in the past. This would give us more robustness for this RFC's design and less reason to refactor the architecture in the long run.

# Detailed Design

The first section will talk about the requirements and basic primitives that a client should be able to do when interacting with the protocol. This will make a good segway for explaining the proposed design. The last section will discuss consistency issues that could occur with this design.

## Requirements

__NOTE: The types presented in OCaml code are disk representations of the types__

In the Coda blockchain, there would be many different transactions sent and received from various people in the network. We would only be interested in hearing about several transactions involving certain people (i.e. friends). Therefore, a client should only keep a persistent record of transactions involving a white-list of people and they should be able to look up the contents of these transactions from a container. Here are the records for a transaction. Note that transactions could be either `user_commands` or `fee_transfers` for this design:

```ocaml
module User_commands = struct
  type t = {
    id: string;
    is_delegation : bool;
    nonce: Unsigned64.t;
    from: Public_key.Compressed.t;
    to: Public_key.Compressed.t;
    amount: Unsigned64.t;
    fee: Unsigned64.t;
    memo: string;
    first_seen: Time.t
  }
end

module Fee_transfer {
  id: string;
  fee: Int64.t;
  receiver: Public_key.Compressed.t;
  time: Time.t
}
```

Additionally, clients should be able to know which blocks contains a transaction. These blocks can give us useful information about a transaction, like the number of block confirmations that is on top of a certain transaction and the "status" of a transaction. Therefore, a client should be able to store a record of these interested blocks and look them up easily in a container. Here is the type of a block:

```ocaml
module Blockchain_state = struct
  type t = {
    staged_ledger_hash: string;
    snarked_ledger_hash: string;
    time_stamp: Date.t
  }

end

module Consensus_state = struct
  type t = {
    blockchain_length: int;
    epoch: int;
    slot: int;
  }
end

module Protocol_state = struct
  type t = {
    consensus_state: Consensus_state.t;
    blockchain_state: Blockchain_state.t;
    ledger_proof_nonce: Int64.t; (* Need to implement #3083 *)
  }
end


module Block = struct
  type t = {
    state_hash: string;
    creator: Public_key.Compressed.t; (* Can be retrieved from the staged_ledger_diffs *)
    protocol_state: Protocol_state.t;
    status: consensus_status;
    block_length: int
  }
end
```

The OCaml implementation of an `external_transition` is different from the presented `Block.t` type as it has the field `ledger_proof_nonce` and `status` to make it easy to compute the `transactionStatus` query, which will tell us if a transaction is snarked and its `consensus_status`. `consensus_status` for an block is variant type and is described below:

```ocaml
type consensus_status =
  | Failed (* Frontier removed block and never reached finality *)
  | Confirmed (* block reached finality by passing the root *)
  | Pending of int (* Block is somewhere in the frontier and it indicates the block confirmation number of the block *)
  | Unknown (* Could not compute status of block i.e. This can happen after we bootstrap and we do not have a `transition_frontier` anymore *)
```

Notice that `PENDING` in `consensus_status` is the number of block confirmations for a block. This position has nothing to do with a block being snarked or not, so `Snarked` is not a constructor of this variant.

With the blocks and `consensus_status`, we can compute the status of a transaction. We will denote the status of a transaction as the type `transaction_status`. `transaction_status` is very similar to `consensus_status` with the additional variant of a transaction being `Scheduled`. Below is the variant of the type:

```ocaml
type transaction_status =
  | Failed (* The block has been evicted by the `transaction_pool` but never gotten added to a block OR all of the transitions containing that transaction have the status Failed *)
  | Confirmed (* One of the transitions containing the transaction is confirmed *)
  | Pending of int (* The transaction is in the `transition_frontier` and all of transitions are in the pending state. The block confirmation number of this transaction is minimum of all block confirmation number of all the transitions *)
  | Scheduled (* Is in the `transaction_pool` and not in the `transition_frontier`. *)
  | Unknown
```

We can use `ledger_proof_nonce` to compute if a transaction is snarked. `ledger_proof_nonce` which start at 0 and is incremented every time a ledger proof is included into the blockchain proof. When you add transactions to a block, mark each transaction with an expected ledger nonce of `state.ledger_proof_nonce + m + {0,1}`, where `m` is the depth (and parallelization factor) of the staged ledger, and `{0,1}` is picked based on whether the transaction fits in the current staged ledger layer or rolls over into the next one. You know a transaction has been snarked at some state in the network iff `state.ledger_proof_nonce >= transaction.expected_ledger_proof_nonce`.

We also have the `receipt_chain_hash` object and is used to prove a `user_command` has been executed in a block. It does this by forming a Merkle list of `user_command`s from some `proving_receipt` to a `resulting_receipt`. The hash essentially represents a concise footprint of the sequence of user commands that have been executed since genesis to a certain point in time. The `resulting_receipt` is typically the `receipt_chain_hash` of a user's account on the ledger of some block. More info about `receipt_chain_hash` can be found on this [RFC](rfcs/0006-receipt-chain-proving.md) and this [OCaml file](../src/lib/receipt_chain_database_lib/intf.ml).

Below is an OCaml API of involving `receipt_chain_hash` type:

```ocaml
module Receipt_chain_hash = struct
  type t = {
    hash: string
    previous_hash: string
  }

  val compute_receipt : ~prev:t -> User_command.t -> t
end

module Receipt_chain_database = struct
  type t = (Receipt_chain_hash.t, Receipt_chain_hash.t)Key_value_store.t

  val add : previous:Receipt_chain_hash.t -> t -> User_command.t -> unit

  val prove : t -> proving_receipt:Receipt_chain_hash.t -> resulting_receipt:Receipt_chain_hash.t ->
(Receipt_chain_hash.t, User_command.t) Payment_proof.t Base.Or_error.t

  val verify : t -> resulting_receipt:Receipt_chain_hash.t ->
(Receipt_chain_hash.t, User_command.t) Payment_proof.t ->
(unit, Error.t) Pervasives.result
end
```

These containers should also have performant pagination queries, which is essentially a single contiguous range of sorted elements. Namely, we order blocks and transactions by some notion of time. These metrics of time vary based on a client's needs.

Blocks and transactions can be ordered by the time it is first seen. The first time we see a block is considered to be the time it gets added to the `transition_frontier`. The first time we see a transaction would be the first time we see it in the `transaction_pool` or when it gets added into a block in the `transition_frontier`.

We can order these objects by the lexicographic ordering of block length, epoch and slot. We will denote this ordering as `block_compare`. `block_compare` length can arguably be a better ordering for blocks because clients can receive blocks at different times, but what remains constant is the `block_compare` that the block appears in the blockchain.

The ocaml code to sort blocks can be seen as the following:

```ocaml
val block_compare = lexicographic [
  Comparable.lift Length.compare ~f:Block.block_length;
  Comparable.lift Epoch.compare ~f:Block.epoch;
  Comparable.left Epoch.Slot.compare ~f:Block.epoch_slot
]
```

Additionally, we can sort transactions by the minimum `block_compare` of the blocks that they appear in. Typically, a client would expect to receive a transaction at the chain that honest peers are building. This honest chain should have a small `block_compare` to other blocks. If the transactions do not appear in an block, they will not appear in the sorting.

A drawback with sorting blocks and transaction based on the time that they are first seen is that if the client wants to store an arbitrary transaction and block, then they would not have the extra burden of tagging these objects with a timestamp for pagination. Block length alleviates this issue.

## Implementation

This section will discuss a proposal where all the database updates are written by an `archive_process`. The `archive_process` will get updates of the `transaction_pool` and `transition_frontier` through diffs. Once it receives the diffs, the `archive_process` will update the database appropriately.Then,there will be an API component that make answer client queries using the daemon and the databases.

Below is a diagram of how the components in this RFC will depend on each other:

![Client storage](../docs/res/client_storage.dot.png)

The yellow nodes represent the entire component that the node is in.

A persistent database that we would like to introduce into our codebase is `SQLite`. `SQLite` would be the best relational database for our use case because it has an Apache 2 license and its a very small binary (3.7MB on my Macbook). `SQLite` is a good choice if a client wants to run the lite version of `coda` (like an iOS version of our wallet app or an embedded device). `SQLite` has a considerably good amount of support for OCaml compared to the other databases that will be discussed and it would be relatively easy to get `SQLite` working off. There is even a nice OCaml library called [ocaml-sqlexpr](https://github.com/mfp/ocaml-sqlexpr) that enables us to embed type-safe `SQLite` queries onto our OCaml code.

We can also use `Postgres` as it is more performant than `SQLite` and is better than `SQLite` for performing complex queries. `Postgres` is a better choice than `SQLite` for a node that wants to track high amounts of data in the network.

For the objects discussed in the previous section, we can embed them as tables in one global SQL database. Below are the schemas of the tables:

```
Enum consensus_status {
  confirmed [note: "The block has reached finality by passing the root"]
  pending [note: "The block Still in the transition frontier. There is no annotation of block confirmation of number "]
  failure [note: "The block Got removed from the transition frontier"]
  unknown [note: "After becoming online and bootstrapping, we may not know what will happen to the block"]
}

Table block {
  state_hash string [pk]
  creator string [not null]
  .... (fields of relevant protocol_state and consensus_state are flattened and explicitly written )
  staged_ledger_hash string [not null]
  ledger_hash string [not null]
  epoch int [not null]
  slot int [not null]
  ...
  columns
  ledger_proof_nonce int [not null]
  status consensus_status
  block_length int [not null]
}

Table user_commands {
  id string [pk]
  is_delegation bool [not null]
  nonce int64 [not null]
  from string [not null]
  to string [not null]
  amount int64 [not null]
  fee int64 [not null]
  memo string [not null]
  time_first_seen date
  is_manually_added bool [not null]
}

Table fee_transfers {
  id string [pk]
  fee int64 [not null]
  receiver string [not null]
  time_first_seen date
  is_manually_added bool [not null]
}

Table block_to_transactions {
  state_hash string [ref: > block.state_hash]
  transaction_id int [not null, ref: > user_commands.id, ref: > fee_transfers.id]
  time_seen_transaction date
  sender string
  receiver string [not null]
  block_length length
    Indexes {
    state_hash [name:"block"]
    transaction_id [name: "transaction"]
    (receiver, block_length, epoch, slot) [name: "fast_receiver_block_compare_pagination"]
    (sender, block_length, epoch, slot) [name: "fast_sender_block_compare_pagination"]
    (receiver, time_seen_transaction) [name: "fast_receiver_time_seen_transaction_pagination"]
    (sender, time_seen_transaction) [name: "fast_sender_time_seen_transaction_pagination"]
  }
  // Rows are uniquely identified by `state_hash` and `transaction_id`
}


// Use Rocksdb for this
Table receipt_chain_hashes {
  hash string [pk]
  previous_hash string
}
```

Below is an image of the relationships of the schemas:

![Client process](../docs/res/coda_sqlite.png)

Here is a link of an interactive version of the schema: https://dbdiagram.io/d/5d30b14cced98361d6dccbc8

Notice that all the possible joins that we have to run through the `block_to_transactions` table. The `transaction_id` and `state_hash` columns are indexed to make it fast to compute which transactions are in an block and which blocks have a certain transaction for the `transactionStatus` query. We have multicolumn indexes for `(receiver, block_length, epoch, slot)` and `(sender, block_length, epoch, slot)` to boost the performance of pagination queries where are sorting based on `block_compare`.

We also have multicolumn indexes for `(receiver, time_seen_transaction)` and `(sender, time_seen_transaction)` to boost the performance of pagination queries where we are sorting based on the time we first see a transaction. The join table has quite a bit of indexes, which will impact the performance of the table when performing write updates. If the writes are too slow, then the join table should have only one type of pagination comparison. We should prefer `block_compare` over `time_seen_transaction` since `time_seen_transaction` is a mutable field and the change to this field would cause more index updates to `time_seen_transaction`.

### Archive Process

To offload many database writes that has to be conducted by the daemon, we are going to delegate the writes to another process, which will be called an Archive Process. Whenever the `transition_frontier` and the `transaction_pool` makes an update, they will send the diff representing the update to the process. The diffs of the `transition_frontier` that the archive process will receive will be similar to `Transition_frontier` extension diffs. Currently, these diffs contain breadcrumbs and we cannot serialize breadcrumbs, so the diffs that clients will be receiving will be the following:

```ocaml
module Transition_frontier_diff = struct
  type t =
    | Breadcrumb_added of {block:  (block, State_hash.t) With_hash.t; sender_receipt_chains_from_parent_ledger: Receipt_chain_hash.t Public_key.Compressed.Map.t}
    | Root_transitioned: of {new_: state_hash; garbage: state_hash.t list}
end
```

`Breadcrumb_added` has the field `sender_receipt_chains_from_parent_ledger` because we will use the `receipt_chain_hashes` from the interested senders of the parent ledger of the new added breadcrumb to compute the `receipt_chain_hashes` of the transactions that appear in the breadcrumb. More of this will be discussed later.

The `transaction_pool` diffs will essentially list the transactions that got added to the `transaction_pool`

```ocaml
module Transaction_pool_diff = struct
  type t = User_command.t list
end
```

The daemon will send data involving users that they are interested in following. Therefore, when the daemon sends a `Transaction_diff` to the archive process, it will only send transactions involving participants that a client is interested in following. Likewise, when the daemon sends `Transition_frontier_diff.Breadcrumb_added`, the block will only contains transactions that a client is interested in following as well.

Whenever the daemon produces a new `Transition_frontier_diff`, it will batch them into the buffer, `transition_frontier_diff_pipe`. The buffer will have a max size. Once the size of the buffer exceeds the max size, it will flush the diffs to the archive process. To make sure that the archive process applies the diff with a low amount of latency, the buffer will flush the diffs in a short period amount of time (like 5 seconds). There will be a similar buffering process for the `transaction_pool`.

Below is psuedocode for persisting a transaction when the archive process receives a `Transaction_pool_diff`:

```ocaml
let write_transaction_with_no_commit sqlite txn ?time_first_seen ~is_manually_added external_transition_opt =
  Sqlite.write sqlite['transaction'] txn;
  let state_hash = Option.map external_transition_opt ~f:With_hash.hash
  in
  let block_length = Option.map external_transition_opt ~f:External_transition.block_length
  in
  let slot = Option.map external_transition_opt ~f:External_transition.slot
  in
  let epoch = Option.map external_transition_opt ~f:External_transition.epoch
  in
  get_time_first_seen sql['transaction'] Transaction.hash_id(txn)
  Sqlite.write sqlite['block_to_transactions']
    {transaction_id=Transaction.hash_id(txn); state_hash; sender= Some (txn.sender); receiver = txn.receiver; block_length = None; time_first_seen; block_length; slot; epoch; is_manually_added }

let write_transaction sqlite txn account_before_sending_txn =
  write_transaction_with_no_commit sqlite txn account_before_sending_txn None
  Sqlite.commit sqlite
```

The archive process will similarly persist a block along with its transactions whenever it receives the `Breadcrumb_added` diff. Additionally, we will compute the `receipt_chain_hash` of each `user_command` in the block using `Breadcrumb_added.sender_receipt_chains_from_parent_ledger`. This new computed `receipt_chain_hash` along with its parent `receipt_chain_hash` will be added to the `Receipt_chain_datbase` Below is psuedocode for persisting a block:

```ocaml
(* filtered transition only contains transitions that we are interested in following *)
let write_block (~sender_receipt_chains_from_parent_ledger: Receipt_chain_hash.t Public_key.Compressed.Map.t) ~sqlite ~receipt_chain_database filtered_transition_with_hash previous_ledger date =
  let {With_hash.data=filtered_transition; hash=state_hash} = filtered_transition_with_hash in
  let transactions = Staged_ledger_diff.transactions @@  External_transition.staged_ledger_diff filtered_transition in
  let saved_block = {
    state_hash = State_hash.to_string state_hash;
    creator = Staged_ledger_diff.proposer (External_transition.staged_ledger_diff)
    status=Pending
    ...
  } in
  Sqlite.write sqlite['block'] saved_block;  
  List.iter transactions ~f:(fun transaction ->
    (* Add receipt chain hashes*)
    (match transaction with
    | User_command user_command ->
      let previous = Option.value_exn (Ledger.get sender_receipt_chains_from_parent_ledger transaction.sender) in
      Receipt_chain_database.add ~previous receipt_chain_database transaction
    | _ -> ());
    let previous_sender_account = Option.value_exn (Ledger.get_account ledger location) in
    write_transaction_with_no_commit ~time_first_seen:date sqlite ~is_manually_added:false transaction previous_sender_account transition_with_hash
  )
  Sqlite.commit sqlite
```

When the archive process receives the `Root_transitioned` diff, it will mainly update the `consensus_status` of a block. Below is the psuedocode for it:

```ocaml
let update_status sqlite finalized_transition deleted_transitions =
  Sqlite.update sqlite['block'] finalized_transition.hash Confirmed;
  List.iter deleted_transitions ~f:(fun deleted_transition ->
    Sqlite.update sqlite['block'] deleted_transition.hash Failed;
  );
  Sqlite.commit sqlite
```

#### Client Queries

A query that a client makes will make use of both the daemon and the database. For the short term, the daemon will service all of the client's queries, namely through GraphQL. The daemon will make reads from the database asynchronously. In the future, we can offload the the client queries to another process, which we will call the API process if these queries become a bottleneck. The downside of this is that we will have to manually add communication channels between the daemon and the client process. We may use the existing RPC tools that we have or have the daemon answer queries through GraphQL. The following subsections will describe queries how to use the databases to make complicated queries:

#### Transaction_status

This service can tell us the consensus status of transaction as well as if it is snarked or not. The consensus status is based on which blocks that they are in. The snarked status is based on the `ledger_proof_nonce` of the blocks that they are in as well as the `ledger_proof_nonce` of the best tip. Below is the SQL query that can help us compute the status of a transaction:

```SQL
--- query_transaction_status
SELECT state_hash, ledger_proof_nonce, status FROM
blocks
INNER JOIN block_to_transactions on
  block_to_transactions.transaction_id = $TRANSACTION_ID

--- is transaction_added_manually
SELECT is_manually_added FROM
transactions
WHERE id = $TXN_ID
```

We can use this query in psuedocode as the following:

```ocaml
val compute_block_confirmations Transition_frontier.t -> State_hash.t list -> (State_hash.t * int) list
let compute_block_confirmations frontier state_hashes =
  failwith("Need to implement: For a given set of state_hashes, compute their block confirmation number in a memorized manner. We can make an extension that computes the block confirmation number for each block in the transition_frontier")

let is_transaction_snarked = failwith("Need to implement")

let get_transaction_status ~frontier ~sql ~txn_pool txn best_tip_breadcrumb : (bool * transaction_status)=
  let sql_result = transaction_status_sql_query sql txn_id in
  if Transaction_pool.member txn_pool txn then (false, Scheduled) else
  (
  match sql_result with
  | [] ->
    if (not Transaction_pool.mem txn_pool txn_id) || is_transaction_added_manually_sql_query sql txn_id then
    (false, Unknown) else (false, Failed)
  | results ->
      let transaction_status =
        if List.for_all results ~f:(fun (_, _, `Consensus_status status)  -> Consensus_status.equal status Failed) then
          (false, Failed)
        else
        List.find_map results ~f:(fun (_, `Ledger_proof_nonce nonce, `Consensus_status status)  ->
          Option.some_if (Consensus_status.equal status Confirmed) nonce)  |>
        Option.map  
          ~f:(fun ledger_proof_nonce ->
            (is_transaction_snarked best_tip_breadcrumb ledger_proof_nonce, true)
          ) |>
        (function
        | Some result -> result
        | None -> (* Transaction is in the transition_frontier *)
          let block_confirmations = compute_block_confirmations frontier (List.map results ~f:(fun (`State_hash hash, _, _) -> hash )) in
          let (arg_max_state_hash, max_block_confirmation) = List.fold block_confirmations ~f:(fun ((curr_max_state_hash, curr_max_confirmations) as acc) (state_hash, confirmations) ->
          if confirmations > curr_max_confirmations then
            (state_hash, confirmations) else acc
          ) in
          (is_transaction_snarked best_tip_breadcrumb (List.find_map_exn results ~f:(fun `State_hash state_hash, `Ledger_proof_nonce nonce _) -> Option.some_if (State_hash.equal arg_max_state_hash state_hash) ), Transaction_status.Pending max_block_confirmation)
        )
  )
```

#### Pagination Queries

We can paginate `blocks` (sorting by `first_seen`) query using the following SQL query

```SQL
-- blocks

SELECT state_hash, transaction_ids, time_seen, creator, ....FROM
(
SELECT state_hash, CONCAT(transition_to_transactions.transaction_id) as transaction_ids, MIN (transition_to_transactions.time_seen_transaction) as time_seen
FROM transition_to_transactions
GROUPBY transition_to_transactions.state_hash
HAVING ((transition_to_transactions.sender IN $SENDERS) OR (transition_to_transactions.receiver IN $RECEIVERS))
) as group_by
INNER JOIN
external_transitions
ON group_by.state_hash = external_transitions.state_hash
WHERE group_by.time_seen > $TIME_SEEN
ORDER BY time_seen
LIMIT 10
-- Would need to use a groupby query to make query the transactions as well
```

#### Pooled_user_command

`pooled_user_commands` should query the `user_commands` that is either sent or received by a certain public key.
The current implementation of `pooled_user_commands` would query all the `user_commands` that a sender sent in the transaction pool. This was straightforward to implement as the `indexed_pool` had a look up from sender's public keys to their transactions in the pool. If we would like to query all `user_commands` for a receiver, we can look up all the `user_commands` received by a user in the database. Then, see if those transactions appear in the transaction id look up table.

### Deleting data

For this design, we are assuming that objects will never get deleted because the client will only be following transactions involving a small number of public keys. These transactions cannot be deleted because they are components used to prove the existence of transaction. We could delete blocks that failed to reach finality and the transaction involving them. However, the concept is outside of the scope of this RFC.

### Adding Arbitrary Data

Since a node can go offline, it can miss gossipped objects. If this happens, a client would be interested in adding manually adding these objects into the client storage system. This storage system has the flexibility to do this.

For adding arbitrary transactions, the client could simply add it to the `transactions` database with `is_manually_added=true`. We can add arbitrary `receipt_chain_hashes` along with its parents to the `receipt_chain` database. The user can arbitrary blocks along with their transactions into the `blockss_to_transactions` table, `external_transitions` and `transactions` database. When we add a transition whose block length is greater than root length, the `transition` will be added through the `transition_frontier_controller`. Namely, the `transition` will be added to the `network_transition_writer` pipe in `Coda_networking.ml`.

<a href="bootstrap"></a>

### Running Bootstrap

If a client is offline for long time and they have to bootstrap, then they would not have a `transition_frontier`. Therefore, all the transitions in the `transition_frontier` would have their `consensus_status` be considered to `UNKOWN`.

## Consistency Issues

As mentioned in the [Running Bootstrap section](#bootstrap), we would not be able to fully determine the `consensus_status` of the block that were in the transition_frontier. Worse, we would not be able to determine which blocks became snarked.

We can have a third-party archived node tell a client the consensus_state of the blocks. Another option that we have is that we can create a P2P RPC call where peers can give a client a Merkle list proof of a state_hash and all the state_hashes of the blocks on top of the state_hash. The Merkle list should be length `K`, the number of block confirmations to gaurantee finality with a very high probability. If the Merkle list proof is size `K`, then the block should be fully confirmed. Otherwise, the block failed.

# Rationale and Alternatives

- Makes it easy to perform difficult queries for our protocol
- Makes the client code more module
- The current implementation takes a lot of work and it is quite limited for a certain use case.
- Other alternatives are discussed in the previous commits of this [RFC](https://github.com/CodaProtocol/coda/pull/2901)
- In an ideal world where we have an infinite amount of time, we would implement our own native graph database leverage the `transition_frontier` as an in-memory cache. Namely, we would have all the blocks in the `transition_frontier` to be in the in-memory cache along with nodes that have a 1 to 2 degree of seperation

# Prior Art

Ethereum is representing their data as patricia tries and are storing them in LevelDB.

Coinbase also uses MongoDB to store all of the data in a blockchain.

# Unresolved questions

- How can we extend this design so that a client has multiple devices (i.e. Desktop application, mobile, etc...).

# Appendix

The flexibility of this new design changed some parts of the schema of the GraphqQL database. Here is the schema:
